// the alu needs to take inputs such the bytes the operations will be preformaed on.
// it will also require a flag to tell the ALU the operation that is being preformed.
// with the flag it needs to call the operation on the bytes.
// some operations require one set of bytes so there will have to be seperate funcitons
// a variable amount of arguments is required to get this funcitonality to work.
